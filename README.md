When designing agentic workflows to generate training plans for living organisms, such as dogs, it is crucial to
prioritize control and reproducibility to ensure safe and consistent outcomes. LangGraph was chosen for this work
because its graph-based architecture enables precise orchestration of agent interactions and workflows. This structure
allows each step of the plan-generation process to be explicitly defined, monitored, and adjusted as needed, ensuring a
high degree of transparency and traceability. Unlike more autonomous frameworks that emphasize rapid iteration or
emergent behaviors, LangGraph provides fine-grained control over agent operations, minimizing the risk of unintended
actions. Its modular design not only allows for the incorporation of domain-specific constraints but also supports the
implementation of automated tests at each stage of the workflow. These tests further enhance safety and reproducibility
by validating the correctness of intermediate outputs and ensuring compliance with predefined standards. These features
make LangGraph particularly well-suited for applications involving living beings, where safety, predictability, and
ethical considerations are paramount.
